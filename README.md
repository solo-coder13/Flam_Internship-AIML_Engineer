# Flam Assignment: Seamlessly Integrating a Person into a Scene Using Hybrid DL Model (UÂ²-Net + MODNet)

### Objective
This project implements an AI-driven pipeline to **seamlessly integrate a person into a background scene**, producing a **photorealistic final composite image**. The pipeline addresses real-world challenges like **shadow casting**, **lighting direction**, **color harmonization**, and **edge blending**, ensuring the output looks naturally captured.
